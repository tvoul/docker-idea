This branch is currently a template for creating new branches with basic contents related to the Docker project.
After you create a new branch, edit the Dockerfile and dockerSettings accordingly. This file (ReadMe) can also be updated to reflect to work in your branch.

Dockerfile - a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image.


dockerSettings - information about which branches you want to create containers from (your own one and other branches with services you want to communicate with) and on which port they should be running.
